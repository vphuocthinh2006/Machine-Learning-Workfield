    "# So how does XGBoost work?\n",
    "# It builds an ensemble of weak learners (usually decision trees) in a sequential manner.\n",
    "# Each new tree is trained to correct the errors made by the previous trees.\n",
    "# The final prediction is made by combining the predictions of all the trees, typically through a weighted sum.\n",
    "# XGBoost is known for its speed and performance, making it a popular choice for many machine learning tasks.\n",
    "# Say that, there is an information_gain function that helps to decide the best feature to split the data at each node of the tree.\n",
    "# Information gain is a measure used in decision trees to determine which feature to split the data on at each node.\n",
    "# It quantifies the reduction in uncertainty or entropy about the target variable after splitting the data based on a particular feature.\n",
    "# The feature that provides the highest information gain is chosen for the split, as it helps to create more homogeneous subsets of data.\n",
    "# Information gain is calculated as the difference between the entropy of the original dataset and the weighted sum of the entropies of the subsets created by the split.\n",
    "# Entropy is a measure of uncertainty or impurity in the data, and it is calculated using the formula:\n",
    "# Entropy(S) = - Σ (p(x) * log2(p(x)))\n",
    "# where p(x) is the proportion of instances belonging to class x in the dataset S.\n",
    "# The information gain for a feature A is then calculated as:\n",
    "# Information Gain(S, A) = Entropy(S) - Σ (|Sv| / |S|) * Entropy(Sv)\n",
    "# where Sv is the subset of S for which feature A has value v, and |Sv| is the number of instances in Sv.\n",
    "# The feature with the highest information gain is selected for the split at that node in the decision\n",
    "# tree, as it helps to create more informative and effective splits that lead to better classification or regression performance.\n",
    "# Note: Information gain is commonly used in algorithms like ID3 and C4.5 for building decision trees.\n",
    "# However, XGBoost uses a more advanced approach called gradient boosting, which focuses on minimizing a specific loss function rather than relying solely on information gain.\n",
    "# In gradient boosting, the model is built in a sequential manner, where each new tree is trained to correct the errors made by the previous trees.\n",
    "# The objective is to minimize a loss function, such as mean squared error for regression tasks or log loss for classification tasks.\n",
    "# So, how did we do it? We used the information gain concept to guide the splitting of the data at each node of the trees.\n",
    "# This helps to create more informative splits that lead to better predictions.\n",
    "# However, the actual implementation of XGBoost involves more complex techniques, such as regularization, handling missing values, and parallel processing, to optimize the model's performance.\n",
    "# Which is something that we don't learn in basic ML courses.\n",
    "# So, in summary, while information gain is a useful concept for understanding how decision trees work, XGBoost goes beyond that by using gradient boosting to build a powerful ensemble of trees that can achieve high accuracy on various machine learning tasks.\n",
    "# Now, let's build this from scratch so that it can give you the whole concept of how it works without using the library.\n",
    "# Note: Implementing XGBoost from scratch is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of machine learning concepts and algorithms.\n",

### This is the entire Supervised Training's every algorithm description and its details.

Perfect 👏 — since you’re writing for a **`README.md`** (GitHub Markdown), we’ll slightly reformat it from Jupyter-style to **clean, GitHub-optimized Markdown**:

✅ Works perfectly with GitHub’s Markdown renderer
✅ Keeps math equations readable (LaTeX-friendly via `$...$` or `$$...$$`)
✅ Includes code fences and tables
✅ Designed for readability and documentation polish

Here’s your **Linear Regression section**, rewritten for `README.md` 👇

## 🧠 Linear Regression

Linear Regression is one of the most fundamental algorithms in supervised learning.  
It models the relationship between a **dependent variable** `y` and one or more **independent variables** `X` by fitting a straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions).

---

### 📘 Concept

The goal of Linear Regression is to find a line that best fits the data:

$$
\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \dots + \beta_nx_n
$$

Where:
- $\hat{y}$ — predicted output  
- $\beta_0$ — intercept (bias term)  
- $\beta_i$ — coefficients for each feature $x_i$  
- $n$ — number of input features  

The coefficients $\beta$ are found by minimizing the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** between predictions and actual values.

---

### ⚙️ Objective Function

$$
J(\beta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)})^2
$$

Where:
- $m$ — number of samples  
- $\hat{y}^{(i)} = \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^{n} \beta_j x_j^{(i)}$

We minimize $J(\beta)$ using either the **Normal Equation** or **Gradient Descent**.

---

### 📐 Normal Equation Solution

$$
\boldsymbol{\beta} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty
$$

This directly computes the best coefficients analytically — ideal for small datasets.

---

### 🧩 Gradient Descent (Iterative)

When $X$ is large, we iteratively update $\beta$:

$$
\beta_j := \beta_j - \alpha \frac{\partial J}{\partial \beta_j}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial J}{\partial \beta_j} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)}
$$

Where:
- $\alpha$ — learning rate (step size)

### 📊 Example (Using Scikit-learn)
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Example dataset
data = {
    "Size": [650, 785, 1200, 1550, 1800],
    "Bedrooms": [1, 2, 3, 3, 4],
    "Price": [70000, 90000, 130000, 175000, 200000]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Features and target
X = df[["Size", "Bedrooms"]]
y = df["Price"]

# Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate
print("Coefficients:", model.coef_)
print("Intercept:", model.intercept_)
print("MSE:", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
print("R² Score:", r2_score(y_test, y_pred))
````

### 🧮 Interpretation

| Metric                       | Meaning                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Coefficients ($\beta_i$)** | How much `y` changes when `x_i` changes by 1 unit |
| **Intercept ($\beta_0$)**    | Predicted value when all features are 0           |
| **MSE**                      | Average squared prediction error                  |
| **R² Score**                 | Percentage of variance in `y` explained by `X`    |

---

### 🧠 Intuition

* Assumes a **linear relationship** between input and output
* Works best for **continuous numerical targets**
* Can extend to **Multiple Linear Regression** or **Polynomial Regression**

### ⚠️ Limitations

| Problem               | Description                                               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Outliers**          | Strongly affect the fitted line                           |
| **Multicollinearity** | Highly correlated features distort coefficients           |
| **Non-linearity**     | Fails when the relationship between X and y is non-linear |

---

### ✅ When to Use

* Predicting numerical outcomes (price, score, temperature, etc.)
* Understanding relationships between variables
